Smash 4 is a fighting game for the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS.

Within the competitive community, there is significant interest in character versus character matchups, influence of stage selection on game outcomes, influence of character attributes on performance, and a desire for a definitive "tier list," or an ordered power ranking of characters.

This repository represents an attempt to provide a statistical perspective to address these questions, and to produce simple, interpretable, and understandable visualizations to convey this information to an audience with no statistical expertise.

The directories are as follows:

* _grab_: Visualization of character grab attributes
* _StockIcons_: Character stock icons in png format suitable for embedding in plots
* _pop_v_results_: Judgement of character under or over performance (results) based on character usage rates (popularity) from tournament data
* _tierlist-1.1.3_: First release of the "official" 4BR backroom tier list (during patch 1.1.3). Revisualization of tierlist to emphasize uncertainty and continuous nature of voting data .
* _tierlist-1.1.6_: Second release of the 4BR tier list (patch 1.1.6). Reviz to emphasize uncertainty, change in placement between lists, and additional analysis to examine character run speed as a predictor of tier list placement.
